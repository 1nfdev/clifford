clifford: Geometric Algebra for Python
=======================================



This module implements geometric algebras (a.k.a. Clifford algebras).  For the
uninitiated, a geometric algebra is an algebra of vectors of given dimensions
and signature. The familiar inner (dot) product and the outer product,
a generalized relative of the three-dimensional cross product, are unified in an
invertible geometric product.  Scalars, vectors, and higher-grade entities can
be mixed freely and consistently in the form of mixed-grade multivectors.
